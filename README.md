Just the humble beginnings


I endeavour to pursue a curious adventure. I have not the knowledge nor experience needed to succeed and I fear the unknown I am certain to face. Will it will be a quick death or a slow meandering pain, strangled by a the vine of time?

Of these things I know not. But I pursue all the same. I will endure until my body sit at rest. I am certain of those things. 

2017. I will learn to code. 

I will architect, design, create, I will build. And I will keep building until my body sit at rest.
